# Java-Project
The Gaming Room is a client that commissioned us to find a solution in expanding their windows exlcusive game to cross-platform. The goal was to expand the game to various platforms while retaining its features, such as unique players, names, and a gallery of images. In this commission I was able to analyze the majority of issues that must be tackled for the project to proceed. I was able to achieve better results as time progressed and my knowledge increased. The multiple revisions to the software design document allowed for further refinement. An area of revision that I would choose would be the system architecture as I did not go into the full depth that I would have hoped, and instead should have provided a high level diagram. The client and their wishes are paramount when designing software, the overall goal is for the satisfaction of the customer in regards of the software and its features. For better future software designs, I will follow the same principles in first acknowledging the customer's requirements and conducting the appropriate research. For future software designs, I intend to follow the same path while adding more check-ins with the customer to ensure the project is to their liking as it progresses.
